### Remarks

When using archive-it its kind of a just [let it run its course](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1197919-206-let-nature-take-its-course-by-letting-each-thing) kind of application.
You give it seeds to start from, then it can stay on those seeds if the user specifies it, or it will crawl the URIs found on the original seeds.
Webrecorder was kind of weird at first since I attempted to use it on my native browser.
I'm assuming I had issues with my chrome plugins which caused some pages not to load.
Luckily since they had a built in browser to emulate my browsing experience it worked out well I believe.
I really liked the feature for saving videos and photo streams.
