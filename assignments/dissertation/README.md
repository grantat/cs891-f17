# Dissertation Palooza

The Ph.D. dissertation assigned to me was "Using Web Archives to Enrich the Live Web Experience Through Storytelling" presented by Yasmin AlNoamany in August 2016.
The goal of this is be able to read a full dissertation and then present upon it in a time interval of 30 minutes instead of an hour.

Her wrap up blog can be found here: http://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2016/09/2016-09-20-promising-scene-at-end-of.html
